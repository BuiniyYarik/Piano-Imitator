## Contributing
If you have questions and suggestions on how to improve our application, write to our e-mail: g-budnik@list.ru

## FAQ
1. If you have difficulty connecting the keyboard - pay attention to the GPU pins on your microcontroller.
2. If your receiving device is not receiving a signal, double-check that you have created your own network and both devices are connected to it.
3. If the buzzer doesn't sound the frequency you want, check your "note notation" in your code.
